# GitHub Actions Cleanup Guide

## Current Status

You have a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to GitHub Pages. If you're switching to Vercel, you should remove this to avoid conflicts.

## Option 1: Delete the Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Remove the entire workflow file
rm .github/workflows/nextjs.yml

# Or remove the entire .github directory if you don't need it
rm -rf .github
```

## Option 2: Disable the Workflow (Keep for Later)

Rename the file to prevent it from running:

```bash
mv .github/workflows/nextjs.yml .github/workflows/nextjs.yml.disabled
```

## Option 3: Keep .github for Other Automations

You might want to keep the .github folder for:

- Issue templates
- Pull request templates
- Dependabot configuration
- Other CI/CD tasks (testing, linting, etc.)

## After Cleanup

1. Commit and push the changes
2. Set up Vercel deployment
3. Vercel will handle all future deployments automatically

## Benefits of Removing

✅ No deployment conflicts
✅ Faster deployments (Vercel is optimized)
✅ No GitHub Actions minutes used
✅ Cleaner repository
✅ API routes work properly
