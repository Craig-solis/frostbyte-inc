# Multi-Client Website Architecture Guide

## Architecture Overview

You want to host multiple client websites under your main domain:
- `frostbyte-inc.com` - Your main business site
- `frostbyte-inc.com/dev` - Your development portfolio  
- `frostbyte-inc.com/poling` - Client wedding website
- `frostbyte-inc.com/client2` - Another client site

## Recommended Approach: Separate Repos + Path Routing

### Benefits
- ✅ **Complete isolation** - Each client's code is separate
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** - Update one client without affecting others
- ✅ **Scalable** - Add unlimited clients
- ✅ **Professional** - Clients get their own development environment
- ✅ **Security** - No cross-contamination between projects

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Repository Structure
```
GitHub Repositories:
├── frostbyte-dev (main site + /dev)
├── poling-wedding-site
├── client2-portfolio
└── client3-business
```

#### 2. Vercel Configuration

**For Each Client Project:**

1. **Create new GitHub repo** for client
2. **Deploy to Vercel** as separate project
3. **Configure custom domain** in Vercel dashboard

**Domain Configuration:**
```
Project: frostbyte-dev
Domain: frostbyte-inc.com

Project: poling-wedding-site  
Domain: frostbyte-inc.com/poling

Project: client2-portfolio
Domain: frostbyte-inc.com/client2
```

#### 3. Vercel Rewrites (Advanced)

In your main site's `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/poling/:path*",
      "destination": "https://poling-wedding-site.vercel.app/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/client2/:path*", 
      "destination": "https://client2-portfolio.vercel.app/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Subdomains (Simplest)
```
frostbyte-inc.com          → Main site
poling.frostbyte-inc.com   → Wedding site  
dev.frostbyte-inc.com      → Your portfolio
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easiest to set up
- ✅ Complete isolation
- ✅ Each site can have different tech stacks

**Cons:**
- ❌ Clients get subdomain instead of path
- ❌ More DNS management

### Option 2: Vercel Multi-Zone
```
Next.js App 1: Main site + routing logic
Next.js App 2: Client sites as zones
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Single domain with paths
- ✅ Seamless navigation

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ All apps must be Next.js

### Option 3: Reverse Proxy
Use your main site as a proxy to route to different services.

## Recommended Setup for Your Use Case

### Phase 1: Current Setup
```
frostbyte-inc.com     → Your main business site
frostbyte-inc.com/dev → Your development portfolio
```

### Phase 2: Add Client Sites
```
frostbyte-inc.com/poling   → Wedding website (separate repo)
frostbyte-inc.com/client2  → Another client (separate repo)
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Keep your current setup** (main site + /dev in one repo)

2. **For each new client:**
   - Create new GitHub repository
   - Build their site independently  
   - Deploy to Vercel with path-based domain

3. **Configure DNS/Routing:**
   - Use Vercel's custom domains
   - Or implement rewrites in main site

## Benefits for Your Business

### For You:
- ✅ **Scalable hosting** - Add unlimited clients
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - All under your domain
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** - Independent deployments
- ✅ **Cost effective** - Vercel free tier per project

### For Clients:
- ✅ **Professional URL** - yoursite.com/clientname
- ✅ **Fast performance** - Vercel's global CDN
- ✅ **Reliable hosting** - Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- ✅ **Easy updates** - You control deployments

## Next Steps

1. **Test with one client** - Create the Poling wedding site
2. **Set up separate repository** for the wedding project
3. **Deploy to Vercel** with custom domain path
4. **Document the process** for future clients
5. **Scale up** as you get more clients

This approach gives you a professional, scalable platform for hosting multiple client websites under your main domain!
