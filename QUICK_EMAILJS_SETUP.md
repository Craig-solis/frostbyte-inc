# Quick EmailJS Setup - Reality Check

## EmailJS Limitation Discovery

**Issue Found**: EmailJS doesn't have a "From Email" field in templates. The sender email comes from the service authentication account.

## Your Actual Configuration Options

### Option 1: Simple Setup (Recommended)

```
EmailJS Service:
- User ID: craig.solis@frostbyte-inc.com
- Password: Katana54!!

EmailJS Template:
- From Name: Craig Solis (FrostByte)
- To Email: webservices@frostbyte-inc.com
- Reply To: {{from_email}}
- Subject: Contact Form: {{subject}}
```

**Result**:

- ✅ Emails come from: craig.solis@frostbyte-inc.com
- ✅ Emails delivered to: webservices@frostbyte-inc.com
- ✅ Replies go to: Form submitter
- ✅ **This works perfectly for contact forms!**

### Option 2: Try Service Account Direct

If you can get `webservices@frostbyte-inc.com` password:

```
EmailJS Service:
- User ID: webservices@frostbyte-inc.com
- Password: [service account password]
```

## Bottom Line

**Option 1 is totally fine!** Contact forms work great even when emails come from your personal account, as long as they're delivered to the right place and replies work correctly.
